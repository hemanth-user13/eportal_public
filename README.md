# Employee Portal

The **Employee Portal** is a Single Sign-On (SSO) application built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. 

## Overview
The primary objective of this application is to provide a dedicated platform for employees to manage their daily activities. 

### Features:
- **Public Access**: Users can visit the website to view posts made by employees. However, to perform any actions, such as creating or interacting with posts, the user must log in.
  
- **Responsive Design**: The application is optimized for laptop and larger screen dimensions.

- **Frontend Only**: The application is entirely frontend-based, with no backend integration. All data is handled within the frontend environment.

- **User Account Management**: The platform includes features for user account management and post creation by authorized users.

- **Post Management**: Users can:
  - View specific posts created by other users.
  - Edit, delete, and update their own posts.
  - Upload media such as images, videos, or audio. The type of content determines how it is displayed on the platform.

## Future Enhancements:
- **AI Bot Integration**: Develop a specialized AI bot for employee support.
- **Project Tracking**: Add a project status feature and other necessary tools for enhancing employee productivity.
